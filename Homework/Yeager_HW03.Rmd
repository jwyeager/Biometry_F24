## Section 4.1

1.  After scoring a touchdown, a football team may elect to attempt a two-point conversion, by running or passing the ball into the end zone. If successful, the team scores two points. For a certain football team, the probability that this play is successful is 0.40.

    -   A:

    ```{r s4.1.1a}
    # Let X = 1 if successful, X = 0 if not. Find the mean and variance of X.
    p <- 0.4
    (mu.X <- p) # mean of X is the same as Pr(Success)
    (sigma.X <- p * (1 - p))
    ```

    -   B: no because the possible values for Y are not 0 and 1

    -   C:

    ```{r s4.1.1c}
    (mu.Y <- 2 * p) # because is 2 bernoulli's
    (sigma.Y <- (4 * p) * (1 - p)) # or 2^2 * sigma.X^2
    ```

2.  When a certain glaze is applied to a ceramic surface, the probability is 5% that there will be discoloration, 20% that there will be a crack, and 23% that there will be either discoloration or a crack, or both. Let X = 1 if there is discoloration, and let X = 0 otherwise. Let Y = 1 if there is a crack, and let Y = 0 otherwise.

```{r s4.1.3}
p.disc <- 0.05
p.crack <- 0.2
p.either <- 0.23

#(a)
(px <- p.disc) # px is same as probability for discoloration
#(b)
(py <- p.crack) # py here is same as crack probability
#(c)
(pz <- p.either) # pz is same as probability either defect being present
#(d)
# Yes, the defects are not mutually exclusive.
#(e)
# No because pz can be zero while px + py cannot.
#(f)
# No, because Z must equal 1 where X + Y = 2
```

11. Penicillin is produced by the Penicillium fungus, which is grown in a broth whose sugar content must be carefully controlled. The optimum sugar concentration is 4.9 mg/mL. If the concentration exceeds 6.0 mg/mL, the fungus dies and the process must be shut down for the day.

```{r s4.5.11}
# a) If sugar concentration in batches of broth is normally distributed with mean 4.9 mg/mL and standard deviation 0.6 mg/mL, on what proportion of days will the process shut down?
mu <- 4.9
sd <- 0.6
x.a <- 6
(z.a <- (x.a - mu) / sd)
(a <- 1 - 0.9664)
(perc.days <- a * 100)

# b) The supplier offers to sell broth with a sugar content that is normally distributed with mean 5.2 mg/mL and standard deviation 0.4 mg/mL. Will this broth result in fewer days of production lost? Explain.
mu <- 5.2
sd <- 0.4
(z.b <- (x.a - mu) / sd)
(b <- 1 - 0.9772)
(perc.days.b <- b * 100)
# yes because although the broth has a higher mean sugar content, the lower sd results in smaller amount of the distribution to lie beyond 6.0mg/L
```

15. The fill volume of cans filled by a certain machine is normally distributed with mean 12.05 oz and standard deviation 0.03 oz.

```{r s4.5.15}

mu.a <- 12.05
sd.a <- 0.03
x.a <- 12
(z.a <- (x.a - mu.a) / sd.a)
# z-score of ~ -1.67 indicates 0.0475

# b) The process mean can be adjusted through calibration. To what value should the mean be set so that 99% of the cans will contain 12 oz or more?
# using z-score of 0.01
z.b <- -2.33
(mu.b <- -(z.b * sd.a) + x.a)

# c) If the process mean remains at 12.05 oz, what must the standard deviation be so that 99% of the cans will contain 12 oz or more?
(sd.c <- (x - mu.a) / z.b)
```

21. Two resistors, with resistances R1 and R2, are connected in series. R1 is normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 5 , and R2 is normally distributed with mean 120 and standard deviation 10.

# a) What is the probability that R2 > R1?
# P(R2 - R1 > 0)
x.a <- 0
(z.a <- (x.a - 20) / sqrt(25 + 100))
# z.a = -1.79, so 0.0367
(a <- 1 - 0.0367)

# b) What is the probability that R2 exceeds R1 by more than 30?
# P(R2 - R1 > 30)
x.b <- 30
(z.b <- (x.b - 20) / sqrt(25 + 100))
# z.b = 0.894, so 0.8133
(b <- 1 - 0.8133)
```

    i.  the estimator is equal to the true value.
    ii. the estimator is usually close to the true value.

    iv. the mean of the estimator is usually close to the true value.

## Section 4.10

1.  Each of three samples has been plotted on a normal probability plot. For each, say whether the sample appears to have come from an approximately normal population.

<!-- -->

a)  Points associated with smaller values lack smooth continuity with rest of points in the sample, and tail "falls off" suddenly suggesting leptokurtosis, but is very close to a normal distribution in appearance
b)  Not normal. Platykurtic perhaps
c)  Normal

# mean and surrounding values reside above line with slope of 1, and 
# both tails stray from line, thus I do not believe these data come from 
# a normal distribution
