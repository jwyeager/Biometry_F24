## Section 7.1

1. Compute the correlation coefficient for the following data set.

x \| 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\
y \| 2 1 4 3 7 5 6

```{r 7.1.1}
x <- c(1:7)
y <- c(2,1,4,3,7,5,6)

(corr <- cor(x, y))
```

3. For each of the following scatterplots, state whether
the correlation coefficient is an appropriate summary,
and explain briefly.  
a) Correlation coefficient is seemingly appropriate because data appears linear,\
and shows positive correlation.\
b) Correlation coefficient is not appropriate as the 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
